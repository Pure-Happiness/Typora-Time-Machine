# Typora Time Machine 0.1

## Introduction

Typora Time Machine can help you solve the error "This beta version of Typora is expired, please download and install a newer version." when starting Typora with one click. The principle behind it is to cheat Typora by modifying your system's date. There is no need to worry it might bring trouble to your using other apps, because the program will immediately return your system's time to normal.

## Usage

Typora Time Machine supposes the path of Typora to be "C:\Program Files\Typora\Typora.exe". If it is not there, please modify path.txt (Remember to add quotation marks if the path contains spaces, and it should end with "Typora.exe").

When starting Typora, run Typora_Time_Machine.exe, which will start Typora automatically.

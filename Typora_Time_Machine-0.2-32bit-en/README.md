# Typora Time Machine 0.2

## Introduction

Typora Time Machine can help you solve the error "This beta version of Typora is expired, please download and install a newer version." when starting Typora with one click. The principle behind it is to cheat Typora by modifying your system's date. There is no need to worry it might bring trouble to your using other apps, because the program will immediately return your system's time to normal.

## Usage

Run Typora_Time_Machine.exe, and you can start Typora. If your Typora is not at the default location, you will receive a popup error window. Close the window, and input the correct path in the program. Remember to add quotation marks if the path contains spaces, and it should end with "Typora.exe", instead of the folder where it is located. Then the program will save the correct path in path.txt automatically and can run normally later.
